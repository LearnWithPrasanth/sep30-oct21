            <h3>Quick SEO early wins</h3>
            <p>  For a brand new blog that’s less than 2 months old right now, I’ve already been able to generate an average of 100+ weekly unique readers from organic search to just 4 articles—and that growth is quickly trending upward. This is due in a large part to applying my long-form,
                 deep dive content creation approach to the hiking/travel niche that doesn’t traditionally have as in-depth of content when it comes to topics like the top Yosemite hikes, the best time to visit Yosemite National Park and more.</p>
