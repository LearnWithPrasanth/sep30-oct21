                A paragraph is a collection of words strung together to make a longer unit than a sentence. Several sentences often make a paragraph. 
                Normally there are 20 to 50 sentences in a paragraph. 
                Paragraphs can start with a five-space indentation or by skipping a line and then starting over. 
                This makes it simpler to tell when one paragraph ends and the next starts simply it has 3-9 lines.
